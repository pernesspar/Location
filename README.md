# Mercury

One of the earliest known recorded observations of Mercury is the Mul.Apin tablets. It is believed that these observations were made by an ancient Assyrian astronomer around 14th century BC. The name used in these tablets is translated as “the jumping planet”. 

Credits cannot be given to a single civilization or person because the planet has always been easy to spot on the sky. What we can do is to give credit to those who first studied the planet by more “modern” means such as Galileo Galilei in the early 17th century, and Giovanni Zupi who in 1639, observed that the planet had phases just like Venus and the Moon.

# Formation
It is theorized that Mercury was formed about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust together to form the small planet. Its small size but enormous core is theorized to be the result of a collision with another giant object that stripped much of its surface.

# Distance, Size and Mass
Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, at a distance of 57.91 million kilometers / 35.98 miles or 0.4 AU away. It takes sunlight 3.2 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mercury.

Mercury has a radius of 2.439 km or 1516 mi, and a diameter of 4.879 km or 3.032 mi. It is about the size of the continental United States, slightly bigger. It has a mass of about 3.285 × 10^23 kg or about 5.5% that of Earth.

Despite being the smallest planet from the Solar System, it is the second densest planet in the Solar System, with a density of 5.43 g/cm³ after Earth. For comparison, Mercury’s size is about a third of Earth, and Earth has a density of 5.51 g/cm³.

Mercury's highly eccentric, egg-shaped orbit takes the planet as close as 29 million miles or 47 million kilometers, and as far as 43 million miles or 70 million kilometers from the Sun. It takes a trip around the Sun every 88 days thus 1 orbit/year is the equivalent of 88 Earth days. Mercury travels through space at nearly 29 miles or 47 kilometers per second, faster than any other planet.

The diagram above illustrates the effects of the eccentricity, showing Mercury’s orbit overlaid with a circular orbit having the same semi-major axis. The resonance makes a single solar day on Mercury last exactly two Mercury years, about 176 Earth days. 

Radar observations in 1965 proved that the planet has a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance, rotating three times for every two revolutions around the Sun. The eccentricity of Mercury's orbit makes this resonance stable at perihelion, when the solar tide is strongest. The Sun is nearly still in Mercury's sky. The orbital eccentricity of Mercury in simulations varies chaotically, from zero or circular to more than 0.45 over millions of years because of the perturbations of the other planets.

More accurate modeling based on a realistic model of tidal response has demonstrated that Mercury was captured into the 3:2 spin–orbit state at a very early stage of its history, within 20 or 10 million years after its formation.

Mercury spins slowly on its axis and completes one rotation every 59 Earth days. But when Mercury is moving fastest in its elliptical orbit around the Sun, and it is closest to the Sun, each rotation is not accompanied by a sunrise and sunset like on most other planets. The morning Sun appears to rise briefly. 

It then sets and rises again from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing happens in reverse at sunset for other parts of the surface. Mercury travels in an elliptical orbit slowing down when it’s farther from the Sun, and accelerating as it draws closer.

The axial tilt is almost zero, with the best measured value as low as 0.027 degrees. This is significantly smaller than that of Jupiter, which has the second smallest axial tilt of all planets at 3.1 degrees. On average, Mercury is the closest planet to Earth, and to each of the other planets in the Solar System.

Surface and Geology
Very similar in appearance to Earth’s moon, Mercury’s surface is scarred by many impact craters from comets or meteoroids. Interestingly, many of these craters are named after famous deceased artists and authors. There are also extensive mare-like plains present and the craters also indicate that the planet has been geologically inactive for billions of years.

 It is believed that Mercury was heavy bombarded by comets and asteroids during and shortly after its formation 4.6 billion years ago, as well as during a possibly separate subsequent event called the Late Heavy Bombardment that ended 3.8 billion years ago.
During this bombardment, Mercury’s entire surface suffered even more because of its lack of atmosphere that would have slowed impacts down. It is believed that Mercury was volcanically active during this period. 

Basins such as the Caloris Basin were filled with magma, producing smooth plains similar to the lunar marias found on the Moon.
